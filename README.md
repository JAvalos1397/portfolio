Welcome to my Portfolio

Here I used the skills I learned in our second weeke of CSS coding to mock up my very own portfolio 

I have responsive design that changes when changing the size of the display.

as well links to future projects 

and a little about me. 
Here is deployment on github https://pepsi1397.github.io/CodeRefactor/
